# arduino-bluetooth-mac
This is an app that connects to an Arduino 101 / Genuino 101 board and simply cases an LED light to blink.  Its basically the same code in this repo: https://github.com/nebs/hello-bluetooth but in Swift 5.  I am just trying to get a feel for writing Swift but the plan is to expand this into a bluetooth musical instrument of some kind
